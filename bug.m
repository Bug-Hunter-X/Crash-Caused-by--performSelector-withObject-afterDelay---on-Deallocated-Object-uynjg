In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:`.  If the object whose selector is being performed deallocates before the delay expires, a crash will occur. This is because the selector will attempt to execute on a non-existent object. This is especially problematic when dealing with asynchronous operations and complex object lifecycles.
